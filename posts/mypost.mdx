          SEO in 2025: How to Boost Your Website Ranking
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Search Engine Optimization (SEO) continues to evolve every year. As Google’s algorithms grow smarter and AI-driven
          search engines emerge, businesses and creators need to adapt their strategies to maintain visibility.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">1. Focus on User Intent</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          In 2025, Google prioritizes search intent over keywords. Instead of stuffing articles with repetitive terms, focus
          on understanding what users truly want when they search. Provide clear, concise, and useful answers that solve
          their problems.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">2. Optimize for Voice and AI Search</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          With smart assistants like ChatGPT, Siri, and Google Assistant driving more searches, optimizing for conversational
          queries is essential. Write naturally and use long-tail keywords that reflect how people speak.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">3. Improve Site Speed and Core Web Vitals</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Fast-loading websites improve user experience and boost rankings. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to
          measure your Core Web Vitals, and optimize your images, scripts, and hosting.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">4. Build Authority Through Quality Backlinks</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Backlinks from high-authority websites remain one of the strongest ranking factors. Focus on building relationships,
          guest posting, and earning mentions from trusted industry sources.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">5. Keep Content Fresh and Relevant</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Regularly update your articles to reflect the latest trends, data, and best practices. Search engines reward websites
          that consistently provide up-to-date and relevant content.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">6. Use Structured Data</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Adding schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and improves your chances of appearing in
          rich snippets and voice results.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-gray-800">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          SEO in 2025 is all about providing value, enhancing user experience, and adapting to AI-powered search. By following
          these strategies, you can future-proof your website and maintain strong visibility across all digital platforms.
